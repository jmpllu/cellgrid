- rename bumpers
- creation script
- refactor GridDisplay ctr to just take Grid
- small grids - should the cell be a neighbour of itself?

Before life perf improvements:

    33.61ms average tick time over 1 500x500 samples of 100 ticks each (29.75 frames/sec)
    34.36ms average tick time over 1 500x500 samples of 100 ticks each (29.10 frames/sec)
    
After making the main eachCell loop a for loop:
    
    30.90ms average tick time over 1 500x500 samples of 100 ticks each (32.36 frames/sec)
    31.20ms average tick time over 1 500x500 samples of 100 ticks each (32.05 frames/sec)
    30.51ms average tick time over 1 500x500 samples of 100 ticks each (32.78 frames/sec)
    
    
After making eachNeighbour loop a for loop:

    10.79ms average tick time over 1 500x500 samples of 100 ticks each (92.68 frames/sec)
    9.87ms average tick time over 1 500x500 samples of 100 ticks each (101.32 frames/sec)
    10.14ms average tick time over 1 500x500 samples of 100 ticks each (98.62 frames/sec)
    
    Also ran fast in the GUI from the start!!!!
